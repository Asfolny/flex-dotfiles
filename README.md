# Dotconfig files
Laptop dotconfig files (flex for the lenovo flex 5 I have)

### Notes
* (bare) Arch linux
* Xanmod Kernel

For other packages, just check pkglist for all installed with pacman explicitly (non-dependency)
Or check apkglist for the "alternative package list", this is a file of things installed that do not exist within pacman (typically AUR, might every now and then include a package that was removed)
